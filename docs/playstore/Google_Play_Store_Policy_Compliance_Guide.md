# Google Play Store — Policy & Guideline Compliance Research
**Purpose:** A consolidated reference of Google Play's official Developer Program Policies and publishing requirements, compiled from Google's own documentation (support.google.com, developer.android.com, play.google). Use this as a checklist to validate that an app is compliant before submission.

**Compiled:** July 25, 2026 | **Primary source:** [Developer Program Policy — effective May 27, 2026](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/17105854?hl=en)

> ⚠️ Policies change often (Google issues updates every few months). Always cross-check the live [Policy Center](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9858052) and the [Announcements page](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/announcements/13412212) before final submission, since this snapshot can drift out of date.

## 4. Privacy, Data & Permissions — What You Must Disclose and Do

Source: [Privacy, Deception and Device Abuse](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877467)

### 4.1 Privacy Policy (mandatory for every app)
- Must be posted at a public, non-geofenced, non-PDF, **editable-only-by-you** URL, linked in Play Console **and** inside the app.
- Must name the developer/entity that matches the store listing.
- Must disclose: what data is collected, how it's used/shared, security practices, retention/deletion policy, and a contact method.
- Source: [User Data policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311)

### 4.2 Data Safety Section (Play Console form)
- Must be completed accurately for **every** app, kept in sync with the privacy policy.
- Source: [Data safety section](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469)

### 4.3 Prominent Disclosure & Consent
Required whenever data collection would **not** be within a user's reasonable expectation (e.g., background location, screen recording, contact-list access):
- In-app disclosure (not just in a privacy policy) explaining what's collected and why.
- Explicit affirmative consent (tap to accept) **before** collection begins — no auto-dismiss, no "navigating away = consent."
- Suggested phrasing: *"[App] collects [data] to enable [feature], [scenario]."*

### 4.4 Selling Data — Prohibited
- Personal/sensitive user data may never be **sold** to third parties. User-initiated transfers (e.g., explicit file-sharing) are not considered a "sale."

### 4.5 Account Deletion
- If your app supports account creation, it must let users **delete** the account (not just deactivate) both **in-app** and via an external web URL entered in Play Console.
- Source: [Account Deletion Requirement](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13327111)

### 4.6 Restricted/Sensitive Permissions — Key Rules

| Permission Group | Rule |
|---|---|
| Photos/Video (`READ_MEDIA_IMAGES/VIDEO`) | Only if system pickers (Android Photo Picker) are insufficient; declaration required if targeting API 33+ |
| SMS / Call Log | Only allowed if app is the **default** SMS/Phone/Assistant handler; must stop use immediately if handler status changes |
| Location (fine/coarse/background) | Minimum necessary scope only; never for ads/analytics alone; background use must be core-feature-justified |
| All Files Access (`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`) | Only for apps whose core function needs broad storage access; must pass access review |
| Package Visibility (`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`) | Only for apps needing awareness of/interoperability with any installed app; scoped alternatives preferred |
| Accessibility API | Cannot be used to change settings without consent, bypass security, enable remote call recording, or power autonomous agents; must be documented in listing |
| `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` | Only for core functionality like browsers, file managers, device migration, EMM — never for self-updating outside Play |
| Body Sensors / Health Connect | Must map to fitness, medical monitoring, or research use cases; data may never be sold or used for insurance/employment/ad purposes |
| VPN Service | Core-functionality VPN apps only; must encrypt traffic and disclose in listing; cannot redirect traffic for ad monetization |
| Exact Alarm (`USE_EXACT_ALARM`) | Only alarm/timer/calendar-notification apps |
| Full-Screen Intent | Automatically granted only for alarm/incoming-call apps (API 34+); otherwise must request |
| Age Signals API | Data may be used **only** for legal age-compliance purposes — never ads, profiling, or third-party sale |
| Android Advertising ID (AAID) / App Set ID | AAID only for ads/analytics, must respect opt-out; App Set ID must never be used for ad personalization |

### 4.7 Device & Network Abuse (Prohibited)
Google Play prohibits an app (or any SDK inside it) from interfering with, disrupting, damaging, or gaining unauthorized access to a user's device, other devices, networks, APIs, services, other apps, any Google service, or a carrier's network. Specifically:

- **No self-updating outside Google Play.** An app may not modify, replace, or update itself using any method other than Google Play's own update mechanism.
- **No external/dynamic executable code.** An app (or third-party SDK inside it) may **not download executable code** — dex files, JAR files, native `.so` libraries — from any source other than Google Play. *(Exception: code that runs inside a VM/interpreter that only gets indirect API access, e.g., JavaScript in a WebView/browser, is allowed.)*
- **Interpreted/scripting languages loaded at runtime** (JavaScript, Python, Lua, etc., not packaged with the app) are allowed **only if** they cannot be used to violate other Play policies — i.e., you can't use a runtime script engine as a loophole to smuggle in disallowed behavior.
- **No introducing or exploiting security vulnerabilities.**
- **Third-party API Terms of Service must be respected.** An app may not access or use any service/API in a way that violates that service's own ToS. *Google's own explicit example: your app must not download, monetize, or play back YouTube videos in a way that violates the YouTube API Services Terms of Service* (e.g., stripping ads, bypassing playback restrictions, or building a YouTube-video player/aggregator that functions as a YouTube clone). This is a common real-world rejection reason for apps that embed or play YouTube content.
- **No installing other apps without explicit prior user consent**, and no linking to / facilitating the distribution or installation of malicious software (see also §5.4 Hostile Downloaders below, which covers linking to/bundling non-malicious but unwanted APKs).
- No blocking/interfering with another app's ads; no game-cheating tools that affect other apps' gameplay; no providing hacking instructions or circumventing security protections; no bypassing system power management (Doze/App Standby) unless properly allowlisted; no facilitating third-party proxy services unless that is the app's primary, disclosed, user-facing purpose.
- No use of WebViews with an added JavaScript Interface that load untrusted web content (plain `http://` URLs) or unverified URLs from untrusted Intents.
- No circumventing the Android app sandbox to derive another app's user activity or identity.

**Related sub-policies bundled under Device & Network Abuse:**
- **Foreground Service (FGS) permissions** — for apps targeting Android 14+, each foreground service must declare a valid, justified FGS type (user-initiated/perceptible, stoppable by the user, can't be deferred by the system, runs only as long as needed). [Foreground Services policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888379)
- **User-Initiated Data Transfer Jobs** — this API may only be used for user-initiated network transfers that run only as long as needed; no automatic/background-initiated transfers.
- **FLAG_SECURE** — all apps must respect other apps' `FLAG_SECURE` declaration (which blocks screenshots/screen-sharing of sensitive UI) and must not create workarounds to bypass it, even for Accessibility Tools.
- **On-device Android Containers** — apps that run their own simulated Android environment (app-cloning/multi-instance/virtualization apps) must respect another app's `REQUIRE_SECURE_ENV` manifest flag and refuse to load it, with no proxying or bypass workarounds.

### 4.8 Mobile Unwanted Software (MUwS) Family — Device-Abuse-Adjacent Policies
This is a distinct policy family (separate top-level section in the Play Policy Center) that covers behavior that harms device usability/trust even when it isn't classic "malware." It has four parts:

**a) Mobile Unwanted Software (core policy)**
- App must deliver on its promised value and disclose all bundled software/system changes, with user review/approval of significant changes.
- Must not misrepresent device state (e.g., fake "your device is infected" warnings).
- Must not request or trick users into disabling **Google Play Protect** or other device security protections (e.g., no "unlock this feature if you disable Play Protect" bargains).
- Must not interfere with other apps or normal device usability; ads must be dismissible and not mimic system prompts; uninstall must be straightforward.
- Source: [Mobile Unwanted Software](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9970222)

**b) Hostile Downloaders — directly covers "app installs/links to other app APKs"**
- An app is a **hostile downloader** (banned) if it's believed to be designed to spread Mobile Unwanted Software, **or** if ≥5% of the apps it downloads/installs turn out to be MUwS (minimum sample: 500 downloads / 25 MUwS).
- **Practical rule for you:** an app generally should not link to, bundle, or auto-install other apps' APKs. The only exception is a **major browser or legitimate file-sharing app** — and even then, every download must be **explicitly initiated by the consenting user**, never driven automatically or silently.
- Source: [Hostile Downloaders](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/11189134)

**c) Ad Fraud**
- Banned: invisible/hidden ads, auto-clicking ads or bot-generated ad traffic, faking install-attribution clicks, showing ads outside the app (pop-ups when the user isn't in-app), and misrepresenting the app's identity to ad networks (fake package name, fake OS/device type).
- Source: [Ad Fraud](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9969955)

**d) Unauthorized Use or Imitation of System Functionality**
- System-level notifications may only be used for an app's own integral features (e.g., an airline app's deal alert, a game's promo alert).
- Banned: using a system notification/alert slot to serve an ad, or any notification/alert designed to look like it comes from the Android OS itself.
- Source: [Unauthorized Use or Imitation of System Functionality](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9969861)

**e) Social Engineering** *(formerly named "Impersonation" inside this policy family before a 2020 rename — not to be confused with the separate standalone Impersonation policy in §5.2, which covers brand/identity impersonation specifically)*
- Covers broader manipulation tactics: apps must not mislead users into taking security-relevant actions (e.g., fake "your battery is critical" or fake "update required" prompts designed to get a tap/install) or otherwise psychologically manipulate users into unsafe actions.
- Source: [Social Engineering](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10148323)

## 5. Deception, Impersonation & Malware — What Gets Apps Removed

### 5.1 Deceptive Behavior
Five sub-areas, all prohibited:
1. **Misleading Claims** — false functionality claims, impossible features ("breathalyzer via phone"), fake "Official" titles, election misinformation, false government affiliation.
2. **Deceptive Device Settings Changes** — changing browser/homescreen/system settings without clear, reversible, explicit consent; never as a monetization/third-party service.
3. **Enabling Dishonest Behavior** — no generating fake IDs/passports/SSNs/credit cards; no undisclosed geography/device-based functionality differences; no obfuscating behavior to evade review; must disclose download size before fetching extra assets.
4. **Manipulated Media** — no deepfakes/misleading media about sensitive events, politics, or public figures without clear watermark/disclaimer; exceptions for obvious satire/parody.
5. **Behavior Transparency** — no hidden/dormant/remotely-activated features; app must behave identically for reviewers and real users; no techniques to detect/evade review.

Source: [Deceptive Behavior](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13610059)

### 5.2 Impersonation
- No implying false affiliation with another company/developer/government.

- Source: [Impersonation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888374)

### 5.3 Malware — Zero Tolerance
- Any code that puts a user, their data, or their device at risk is banned outright: trojans, phishing, spyware, backdoors, "riskware" (formerly "maskware" — apps that behave differently to evade detection).
- Must remove any third-party SDK later found to distribute malicious code.
- Source: [Malware](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888380)

## 6. Monetization & Ads

### 6.1 Payments / Billing Rules
- Digital goods, subscriptions, in-app currencies, and app-functionality unlocks **must** use Google Play's billing system (limited exceptions: physical goods/services, peer-to-peer payments, tax-exempt donations, certain gambling-policy-compliant products, alternative billing programs in eligible regions).
- No leading users to external payment methods via listing, in-app webviews, buttons, or sign-up flows (unless enrolled in an eligible alternative-billing program).
- Loot boxes/randomized purchase mechanics must disclose odds before purchase.
- Source: [Payments](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738)

### 6.2 Ads Rules
- Ads/offers must match the app's own content rating (no Mature ads in an Everyone-rated app).
- **No deceptive ads:** must not mimic system UI, OS warnings, or notifications.
- **No disruptive ads:** must not force clicks, must be dismissible, must not appear outside the serving app or on the home screen, must not trigger via home/back button.
- **Better Ads compliance:** no full-screen interstitials at unexpected moments (level starts, app launch splash) and interstitials must be closeable within 15 seconds (exception: opted-in rewarded ads).
- No lockscreen ad monetization unless the app *is* a lockscreen replacement.
- Location data may not be collected solely for ad targeting; must comply with prominent disclosure rules.
- Ad Fraud is strictly prohibited.
- Source: [Ads](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9857753)

### 6.3 Subscriptions
- Terms and pricing must be clear and match the Play billing interface exactly.

- **Title ≤ 30 characters.**
- No emojis, emoticons, repeated special characters, or ALL CAPS (unless part of registered brand).
- No text/images implying ranking ("#1," "Best of Play"), pricing/promotions ("10% off," "Free for a limited time"), or false Play-program affiliation ("Editor's Choice," "New").
- No misleading icon symbols (fake notification dots, fake download/install icons).
- No unattributed/anonymous testimonials, comparison callouts, or keyword-stuffed word lists.
- No sexually suggestive imagery, profanity, graphic violence, or illicit-drug depictions in listing assets — even EDSA content must be listing-safe.
- Source: [Metadata](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9898842)

### 7.2 Content Ratings (IARC)
- Every app must have a completed, accurate IARC content-rating questionnaire; apps without a rating are disallowed.
- Ads shown in-app must not be significantly more mature than the app's own rating.
- Ratings can vary by territory; "Refused Classification" in a territory results in regional removal.

## 9. Families Policy (Apps Targeting or Attracting Children)

Required **only if** any target-audience age group includes children — but read this even if you're unsure, since Google independently assesses whether your imagery/content "targets" children regardless of your declared audience.

Key requirements if children are a target audience:
1. **App content** must be age-appropriate.
2. **App functionality** cannot be a bare webview/affiliate-traffic wrapper.
3. **Play Console answers** (Target Audience, Data safety, IARC questionnaire) must be accurate and kept current.
4. **Data practices**:
   - No transmitting AAID, SIM/Build serials, BSSID, MAC, SSID, IMEI/IMSI from child users.
   - No requesting device phone number via `TelephonyManager`.
   - No precise location collection from apps solely targeting children.
   - Bluetooth must use Companion Device Manager where available.
5. **APIs/SDKs** used must be approved for child-directed services (or gated behind a neutral age screen for mixed-audience apps).
6. **AR features** require a safety warning (parental supervision reminder, physical-hazard awareness) and must avoid devices unsuitable for children.
7. **Social apps/features**: must include online-safety reminders and require "adult action" (PIN/password/ID/etc.) before enabling personal-info exchange for child users. Apps whose main purpose is chatting with strangers (dating apps, chat-roulette, open kids' chat rooms) **must not target children** at all.
8. **Legal compliance**: COPPA (US), GDPR (EU), and other applicable child-privacy laws.

**Ads to children** must:
- Come only from **Google Play Families Self-Certified Ads SDKs**.
- Never be interest-based/remarketing.
- Be content-appropriate, non-disruptive (dismissible within 5 seconds), never full-screen-on-launch, never more than one ad placement per page, and never deceptive/manipulative.
- Never advertise: mature media, mature games/software, alcohol/tobacco/drugs, gambling (even simulated), sexual/dating content, or graphic violence.

## 10. Age-Restricted Content & "Restrict Minor Access"

Some app categories are **required** to block minors using the Play Console's **Restrict Minor Access** feature:
1. Real-Money Gambling, Games & Contests apps.
2. Apps whose **core function** is matchmaking/dating (apps where dating is only an *incidental* feature can instead use effective in-app age-gating rather than the console-level block).

Additionally, Google is separately rolling out **AI-based age-estimation** across its ecosystem (Search, YouTube, Play) that can restrict a Google Account's access to mature/adult-only apps regardless of the developer's own settings — driven partly by new US state laws (Texas, Utah, Louisiana, and upcoming California in 2027).

## 11. Account, Technical & Publishing Requirements

### 11.1 Developer Account Setup
- **Personal account** ($25 one-time fee): for individuals/hobbyists; requires government-ID identity verification if no verified Google Payments profile exists.
- **Organization account**: required for businesses, and *mandatory* for apps in Financial Services, Health, VPN, and Government categories. Requires a **D-U-N-S number** (Dun & Bradstreet business identifier — free, but can take up to 30 days to obtain) plus organization documentation.
- Source: [Choose account type](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13634885) · [Verify developer identity](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10841920) · [D-U-N-S info](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13628312)

### 11.2 Android Developer Verification (separate, newer, platform-wide program)
- Distinct from Play Console account verification. Verifies your **identity** *and* registers the **package name + signing key** of every app so it can be installed on **certified Android devices**, including outside Google Play.
- Enforcement begins **September 2026** in select regions/stores.
- A free "limited distribution" tier exists for students/hobbyists (apps capped at 20 explicitly-authorized devices).
- Source: [developer.android.com/developer-verification](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification)

### 11.3 Closed Testing Requirement (New Personal Accounts)
- Applies to **personal** accounts created **after Nov 13, 2023** (organization accounts exempt).
- Must run a closed test with a minimum of **12 opted-in testers** for **14 continuous days** before production access is granted (reduced from 20 testers in Dec 2024).
- "Opted-in" = tester accepted invite and installed under matching Google account; must remain installed and used throughout the 14 days.
- Source: [App testing requirements for new personal developer accounts](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14151465)

### 11.4 Build & Technical Requirements
- **Format:** Android App Bundle (.aab) — plain APKs no longer accepted for new app submissions. Use **Play App Signing**.
- **Target API level:** must target within 1 year of the latest major Android release for new submissions/updates (as of mid-2026: API 35 minimum, **API 36 required from Aug 31, 2026**; Wear/TV/Automotive floor is one level lower). Existing unupdated apps become invisible to new users on newer OS versions if they fall more than 2 years behind.
- **64-bit architecture:** required for any app shipping native (NDK) code.
- **App icon:** 512×512 px, 32-bit PNG with alpha, ≤1MB. **Feature graphic:** 1024×500 px. Minimum 2 phone screenshots (up to 8 per device type).

## 12. Enforcement & Appeals

- Violations can result in: app rejection, app removal/suspension, or full developer account termination.
- As of late 2025, Google introduced a **180-day appeal window** for account terminations.
- Non-compliant apps typically get **at least 30 days** notice to fix an issue before removal (varies by policy/severity — CSAM and malware are immediate).

## 13. Recency Notes / Things That Changed Recently (as of July 2026)

- **Android Developer Verification** is a brand-new, platform-wide (not just Play-specific) identity + app-registration requirement starting enforcement Sept 2026 — distinct from the older Play Console D-U-N-S/ID verification.
- **Age-Restricted Content** policy was clarified (April 2026) so dating features that are merely *incidental* to an app no longer require full Restrict Minor Access — alternative age-gating suffices.
- **Health & Fitness data guidance** was expanded (April 2026) for new Android 16 Health Connect granular permissions (Menstrual Cycle, Alcohol Consumption, Symptoms) with an explicit ban on using this data for employment/insurance decisions or unauthorized social sharing.
- **Financial Features declaration** is now mandatory for every app on an account, even apps with zero financial features — incomplete declarations block all app updates.
- **Closed testing** requirement dropped from 20 → 12 testers (Dec 2024), still in force for personal accounts.
- **Malware category renamed:** "Maskware" → "Riskware" (Oct 2025) for industry-terminology alignment.
- **Target API level** climbing to API 36 (Android 16) mandatory Aug 31, 2026.
